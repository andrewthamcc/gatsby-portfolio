            In May 2020 I landed a position as a Frontend Software Developer at
            Smooth Solutions. The company is the outsourced development workshop
            for the non-profit energy conservation company{" "}

            I am the sole frontend developer with Smooth Solutions working on
            Greensaver's web application, Energy Conservation Hub. This hub acts
            as a calendar dashboard allowing its users to see their scheduled
            appointments and complete their in home energy audits.

            With ownership of the entirety of the frontend codebase I provide
            feedback and input on the entire application's design and user
            experience. As the only developer I have to find my own solutions
            and surpass my own roadblocks to deliver results. Being a
            development team of one has been challenging and rewarding. I have
            complete control and freedom of input of the frontend development
            process from end to end. I regularly partake in product iteration
            meetings, communicate with project stakeholders, and contribute to
            every key development decisions.

            I would love to be part of a larger development engineering team in
            the future but working as a sole developer has forced me to be
            creative, resilient, and granted me insights to areas of software
            development I normally would not have touched on so early in my
            career.
