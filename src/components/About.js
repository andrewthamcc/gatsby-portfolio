          I'm a developer based in Toronto, Canada. I graduated from The
          University of Toronto with a degree in Physics after which I trained
          and worked as a Chef. I've opened a national test kitchen for Sobeys
          Inc, cooked in fine dining restaurants in Melbourne, Australia, headed
          kitchens in Toronto, and have been a part of food focused technology
          startups.

          In 2019, after a decade of pursuing and accomplishing my childhood
          dream, I decided to retire from the hospitality industry and retrain
          in web development. I've always had a fondness and curiosity for the
          web since I was young teenager learning HTML in the early days of the
          internet. I have also always enjoyed programming which I studied
          throughout high school and during my time at university.

          I'm an adept problem solver, have a strong background of working in
          teams, and enjoy challenge. I'm passionate about technology and using
          code to solve problems and to create and bring websites and web
          applications to life.
