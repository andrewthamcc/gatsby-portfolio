            In 2019 I decided to leave the hospitality industry. While I had
            succeeded and climbed the ladder of professional kitchens I could no
            longer ignore the growing income disparity, lack of employee rights
            and proper employment practices, and new restaurants more often
            being driven by social media influence and sales over quality of
            food and service.

            I decided to attend Juno College (formerly HackerYou) after a close
            friend of mine had completed their program and found employment as a
            Frontend Developer in Toronto. I also had the opportunity to work in
            tech startups and found myself interested in the work the developers
            were doing.

            I've always had a fondness and curiosity for the web since I was
            young teenager learning HTML in the early days of the internet. I
            have also always enjoyed programming; I studied computer programming
            through highschool learning Visual Basic and Java and At The
            University of Toronto I studied Physics and had courses where we
            programmed with Python. I've applied my programming knowledge during
            my studies in various different courses and have also had the
            opportunity to write small bits of code to help my job as a Chef.

            With a background in the sciences and a familiarity with programming
            basics I enrolled into the part time program at Juno College in
            November 2018 and was admitted to their 8-Week immersive program in
            April 2019.

            Even though I miss cooking professionally I haven't looked back to
            professional kitchens. I've onlyl fallen more in love with
            programming and growing my career as a developer. I now just keep to
            cooking at home for my wife, friends, family...
