            I worked with Orthodontic Speaker and Coach Laura Cafik-Martin to
            design, create, and deploy a website of her portfolio, services, and
            information.

            Lauara's website is a three page static site. The biggest challenge
            with creating this website was interpreting Laura's aesthetic
            desires and translating them into a design. I do not have a strong
            design background or skills but felt like we were able to acheive
            her goal of vibrant colours on a dark background and keeping it
            simple with easy to access information.

          <Paragraph>
            In the future we will continue to expand on Laura's website adding
            links to her various content outlets and possibly a blog page. With
            these changes I would also ideally like to translate her site to
            Gatsby with Styled-Components.
